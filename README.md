### 🚨 Security Projects in Action

> “Why code in the dark, when you can shine a light on vulnerabilities?”

- 🕷️ **Vulnerability Scanners:** My digital spiders crawl through code to spot trouble before it bites!
- 🔐 **Authentication Systems:** Fortified logins, multi-factor magic, and access controls—because your data deserves a moat.
- 🛡️ **Pen Testing Scripts:** Automated scripts to probe, prod, and protect against the sneakiest exploits.
- 📢 **Security Awareness Apps:** Fun, interactive projects to keep everyone savvy (and safe) online.

:eyes: **Peek into my repos** for code, demos, and a taste of my security wizardry!

### 🎬 Off the Clock

When the laptop lid closes, you’ll find me:
- 🍿 Binge-watching the latest movies (bonus points for hacker flicks!)
- 🌍 Traveling and collecting stories from the road

I believe life—and code—should be an adventure. Let’s make the web a safer (and more fun) place, together!
